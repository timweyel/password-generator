# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project, we were provided html and css as currently shown in the screenshots below. We were also provided starter javascript code that didn't have any logic to prompt the user are any input that they might have provided. 

## Requirements

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

### Implementation

We were tasked with creating an application that did the following:
* When the user clicks 'Generate Password', they are presented with a series of prompts that ask the following:
* How long should the password be? minimum of 8, maximum of 128 characters
* Would they like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters?
* At least one of each selected character type must be included in the password.
* The generated password matches the selected criteria
* The generated password should either be displayed in an alert or written to the page
